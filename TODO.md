## dota

* ADD ```get_item_details function``` :  gets detailed information about an item from the items page (this page changes every patch so be careful to only get information from elements that do not dissappear once a patch updates)

* ADD ```get_hero_details function``` :  gets detailed information about an hero from the heros page (this page changes every patch so be careful to only get information from elements that do not dissappear once a patch updates)
