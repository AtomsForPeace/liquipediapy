## liquipediapy


***

## dota

* ADD ```get_item_details function``` :  gets detailed information about an item from the items page (this page changes every patch so be careful to only get information from elements that do not dissappear once a patch updates)

* ADD ```get_hero_details function``` :  gets detailed information about an hero from the heros page (this page changes every patch so be careful to only get information from elements that do not dissappear once a patch updates) 

* FIX ``` get_player_info```: To handle players with confliting names and no redirects like [Fury](https://liquipedia.net/dota2/Fury_(NZ_player)) 

## counterstike

* ADD ```get_tournament_info``` :  gets detailed information a tournament from its page , links are a huge problem here and also the format of the tournament is less arbitary then dota2 still uses differnt format tables across pages.
