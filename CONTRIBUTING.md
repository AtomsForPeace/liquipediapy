# How to contribute to liquipediapy

Hi,
Firstly, thanks for wanting to help! as this project is parsing html pages it is gonna break as often as liquipedia updates it pages and I could use any help we can get to keep it alive.I Inititally was using the liquipedia API for some data collection and thought it would be cool to make it into a api everyone could use as liquipedia has a vast amount of information that could benifit a lot of developers.

I havent used any fixed coding convention ans as youll notice Ive used tabs instead of spaces, but if you do want to use a specified convention please use [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) and I will rewrite my code in PEP8 format as soon as I can.
